# EXP_Counter_HTML_Version
A web version of the EXP Counter

One of the issues I've faced going back to old school JRPGs like Dragon Quest 1 and Phantasy Star 2 is that keeping track of experience points can be a real pain. So I devised this web app to keep track of party member experience. Use the accompanying fields to add a new character to the party, remove current party members, directly alter the EXP value of a current party member, and decrease the EXP count of every party member. When you add a new character they'll appear beneath the REDUCE EXP section. Unlike the Python version this doesn't support saving and loading party member data.
